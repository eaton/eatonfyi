"The editing interfaces we offer to users send them important messages, whether we intend it or not. If the primary editing interface we present is also the visual design seen by site visitors, we are saying: 'This page is what you manage! The things you see on it are the true form of your content.' Often, it's a lie: what you're seeing is simply one view of a more complex content element, tailored for a particular page or channel."
