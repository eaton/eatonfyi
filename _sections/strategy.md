I got my start as a freelance tech journalist in the early 90’s, then spent a decade or two designing and building web content management systems. Today, I work with organizations that publish meaningful content — material that’s a core part of the work they do, a critical tool in building relationships with their customers, or central to their fundamental mission.

In most organizations, insights about *why* they create content and what tools they need to do it better are distributed unevenly across many people and roles. Understanding their content, and building tools to support it, means understanding and integrating those different perspectives. I help them make those connections using analysis, research, prototyping, workshopping, training… and lots of conversations.

I have a few areas of particularly deep focus:

* **Multi/Omnichannel Content strategy**: Planning the production, management, and governance of content that will be used across multiple distribution channels. This often intersects with “decoupled” or “headless” approaches to content management.
* **Content architecture**: Modeling specific content types and mapping their relationships, including the architecture of the CMS and editorial tools that will support it.
* **Design System Integration**: Bridging the gap between pattern-oriented visual design, editorial processes, and structured CMS content.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Facilitation**: Negotiating meaningful common ground between design, development, and content production teams.

I’ve done this work for large and small organizations including Apple, the state of Georgia, Harvard University, NBC Universal, The Society of Jesus, and IBM. I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting projects where I can dig deep into these issues.
