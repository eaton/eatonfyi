I got my start as a freelance writer and journalist in the dim recesses of the early 90’s, then spent a decade or two designing and building web content management systems. Today, I work with organizations that publish meaningful content — material that’s a core part of the work they do, a critical tool in building relationships with their customers, or central to their fundamental mission.

In most organizations, insights about *why* they create what they do, and what tools they need to do it better, are distributed unevenly across many people in many different roles. Building an effective plan for their content, and building tools to support that plan, means understanding and integrating those different perspectives. I help teams achieve that focus via analysis, research, prototyping, workshopping, training… and lots of conversations.

I have a few areas of particularly deep focus (some might call them obsessions):

* **Multi/Omnichannel Content strategy**: Planning the production, management, and governance of content that will be used across multiple distribution channels. This often intersects with “decoupled” or “headless” approaches to content management.
* **Content architecture**: Modeling specific content types and mapping their relationships, including the architecture of the CMS and editorial tools that will support it.
* **Design System Integration**: Bridging the gap between pattern-oriented visual design, editorial processes, and structured CMS content.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Facilitation**: Negotiating meaningful common ground between design, development, and content production teams.

I’ve done this work for large and small organizations including Apple, the state of Georgia, Harvard University, NBC Universal, The Society of Jesus, and IBM. I developed a ground-up content strategy practice inside [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com), one of the world’s premier Drupal design and development shops. I’ve written, spoken, and taught about these subjects at events like [Confab](https://www.confabevents.com), [SXSW](https://www.confabevents.com), and [The IA Conference](http://www.theiaconference.com).

If any of that sounds like your cup of tea, I'd love to chat; drop me a line and we'll see what happens.
